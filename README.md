# IoT-Project
This is a home automation cum security system developed at Innogeeks by Anshul, Ravi and Kuldeep
This code can be used to depict a small example of 
	Home-Automation that can also be used as a security system.
    
    Here, when there is low light or complete darkness
    in the room, and any motion is observed on pir sensor,
    Light bulb, connected to a 9V Source battery will 
    light up, as it is connected to relay module which is
    set to power it up when motion is detected in brightness
    level less than 20%.
    Also, there is a sound buzzer, which can be used as an 
    alarm system in case the user is not in the house, which
    can be controlled by a switch.
    
    Case 1: User wants the light to automatically turn on
    		as soon as he enters the dark room.
            
    Solution: He turns of buzzer switch, so when he enters
    		  the room, the buzzer sound doesn.t annoy him/her.
              
    Case 2: User is not in the house and he don't want any
    		person to enter his house.
            
    Soultion: He turns on the buzzer switch, so when someone
    		  enters the room, the buzzer/Alarm system will 
              turn on and inform the neighbours that something 
              is not right. Also, this system can be modified
              to send notification to the user about the 
              intrusion.
            
    
    For the convinience of user, LCD display will show the
    current brightness of the room, with number of motions
    detected previously.
    
    Improvements: Multiple Photoresistive sensors can be used
    			  instead of one. That will give more precise
                  idea of darkness inside the room.
